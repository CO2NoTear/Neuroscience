# Collective Dynamic of "small-world" networks
## Main Idea
1. Big networks in reality are not completely regular nor random, but in the between.
2. Regular networks can be "rewired" into random networks and increase its disorder. By doing this, these networks can show the properties of both regular networks of its highly clustered structure and random networks of its small characteristic path length. Those networks are called **"small-world"** networks.![[Small-world.png]]
3. Neural networks, power grid networks, collaboration graph of film actors are **"small-world"** networks.
4. Models of dynamic system with **"small-world"** networks can be better at signal-propagation, computing, or synchronizing.
5. **"small-world"** phenomenon might be common in sparse networks with many vertices, as even a tiny fraction of short cuts world suffice
6. **"Small-world"** networks can be easily generated. So they can be found in the natural world for large sparse networks.
