# What Have been Learnt

- ANN is inspired by brain, yet not biologically limited. It's a mathematically model.

### Why ANN (Deep Learning) in Neuroscience
1. Mathematically generated models are far better than "hand-constructed" ones.
	- Deep Learning directly training the model on complex tasks, gaining a good result, making human-perfomance AI model possible.
2. Complex brain neural activation patterns are indescribable for *old* simple models, while Deep Learning models is capable for it.
3. To learn ANNs is to learn brains. ANNs can be constrained to the limitations as brains in physical conditions (number of neurons, economy of wiring circuit, etc.), resulting in brain-resembling ANNs. ==To learn how ANNs are trained is to learn how brains are evolved biologically.== **And I guess this is where my TOPIC mainly focusing on.**
# Questions
1. What is plasticity, on earth?
	- See on Section 5.
