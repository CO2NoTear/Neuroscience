# Main Job
- [x] Read reason, search and react strategy in LLM for prompts
- [ ] Read LLM interacting with models on Hugging-face

# What Have been Learnt
- Utilizing external tools or APIs are new directions to improve LLM performance.
- LLM for task planning, models searching and invoking, results gathering and outputting, like a BRAIN.
	- Task planning is the most important part, determining the overall task performance. In other words, poor task planning can lead the workflow to a wrong direction.
- The ability of multimodal processing is up to the models available, not the LLM, so theoretically, this rids LLM off the multimodal limitations, comparing to former ones which unified multimodal LLM.

# Questions
- Uniform of input/output format of the models on hugging face is yet to be settled. LLM decide each model based only on the description of the model, which might not fit other models' requirements, or even did not give out the format. All these problems are transparent to the LLM.


# Interesting Things to be Reminded
- Using language models to do panning and acting in interactive environments: **==Page. 2==**: Ahn et al., 2022; Nakano et al., 2021; Yao et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2022a)
