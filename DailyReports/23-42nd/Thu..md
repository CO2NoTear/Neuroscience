# Main Job
- Read about cognitive tasks on ANN representations
- Find the research direction

# What Have been Learnt
## Construct cognitive tasks on ANNs 
- Cognitive tasks involves sensory, cognitive and motor processes.
- Compositionality: composing elementary processes that are already learnt, the computational task can be done, thus whole cognitive task is done.
- Continual learning is good at preserving previous learnt tasks, similar to the monkey subject's.
## NeuroAI
- Embodied Turing test: focusing on AI animal models to solve sensorimotor tasks with the skills that all animals can do.
